# DICE ROLLING SIMULATOR 

A java program that simulates the rolling of a dice 1000 times.
The program is meant to show or apply random values to generate the number of times a face of the dice appears in the 
1000 rolls. Simple!

The program uses Math.random() java method to generate random numbers between 0 and 1.
The randomness of the system is dependent on the numbers produced by this java method. 
We divide the numbers into a 1/6 th probability, where each one of the six sides is a face of the dice.
